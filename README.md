# EV Vehicle Monitoring Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive vehicle dashboard application that displays real-time data fetched from a backend system. The application allows users to interact with the dashboard, modifying the vehicle's state, which is then reflected in the backend database.

# Live Deployment
The complete application is deployed and available at the following URLs:

- Frontend: https://ev-status-dashboard.netlify.app/
- Backend API: [https://ev-vehicle-monitoring-system.uw.r.appspot.com](https://vehicle-dashboard-179965013028.asia-east1.run.app)


# Technologies Used

# Frontend
- React.js: The user interface is built using the React.js JavaScript library.
- React Hooks: Functional components with React Hooks are used for state management and data fetching.
- Recharts: A popular charting library used to create the power and RPM gauges.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components.


# Backend
- Python: The backend is implemented using the Flask web framework.
- Google Cloud Firestore: A NoSQL document database service used to store and manage the vehicle state data.
- Google Cloud Platform: The backend application is deployed on Google App Engine, a fully managed serverless platform.

# Deployment
- Netlify: The frontend application is hosted on Netlify, a static site hosting platform.
- Google Cloud Firestore: The database is hosted on Google Cloud Firestore, a fully managed NoSQL document database.

# API Endpoints
The application exposes the following API endpoints:

- GET /api/vehicle/state: Retrieves the current vehicle state from the database.
- POST /api/vehicle/motor-speed: Updates the motor speed setting in the database.
- POST /api/vehicle/charging: Toggles the charging state in the database.
- POST /api/vehicle/reset: Resets the vehicle state to default values in the database.

# How to Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ~~~
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ev-vehicle-monitoring-dashboard.git
   ~~~

2. Change to the project directory:
   ~~~
   cd ev-vehicle-monitoring-dashboard
   ~~~
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ~~~
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ~~~
4. Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of your Google Cloud service account JSON file.

5. Start the backend server:
   ~~~
   python main.py
   ~~~
6. In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:
   ~~~
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ~~~
The frontend application should now be available at http://localhost:3000, and the backend API can be accessed at http://localhost:5000/api.
